excerpt: Community bonding period plans that were part of the original proposal
---

The initial part of the community bonding period was utilized to initiate this blog and write the test web application that will be used as a test case for the implemented algorithm. 

The remainder of the community bonding period will be utilized to further conduct research on the project and come up with a concrete implementation plan. Some possible research will include : 

- Possible solutions to differentiate between user initiated and auto initiated downloads.
- Possible solutions to find the origin of a download.
- Deciding upon appropriate places to plug in the state change code. That is, determining where the state associated with a download will have to be changed. Also deciding the place where the condition that determines if user interaction has taken place is evaluated.
- Implementation specifics of instrumenting various parts of the project will be discussed

The answers discovered to these questions will be posted as blog posts during the reamining community bonding period
