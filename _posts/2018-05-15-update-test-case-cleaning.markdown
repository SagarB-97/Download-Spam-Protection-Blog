excerpt: Cleaned code and removed unnecessary dependencies in the Test Web Application
---

Today was spent cleaning up the Repo with the Test application. Nihanth reviewed the code and suggested that I spend some time bringing the repo to its 'bare-bones', so I did.

#### What was cleaned?

- Removed unused 'boilerplate' code generated by `express-generator`
- Removed unused default routes
- Removed dependency on `bootstrap`
- Rewrote code so it longer relies on `jQuery` to make requests
