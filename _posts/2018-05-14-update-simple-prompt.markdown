title:  "Update : Messing around. User prompt displayed for second download"

excerpt: There was an attempt - To display user prompt before the second download of the session
---

The *Google summer of code* **coding period** officially begins today.

Nihanth (@nhnt11) suggested that I try and experiment with the code base to make an attempt at dumping an output to the terminal whenver a download is initiated. This would give us an idea about possible 'plugpoints' in the code base where we can plug in our logic.

I realised `toolkits/components/downloads/DownloadCore.jsm` is the javascript module where a download is actually initiated. Some alteration was made in `DownlaodCore.jsm` and `DownlaodUIHelper.jsm` to try and display a user prompt asking if the user would like to preoceed with the second download of the session.

However, because of failure in synchronisation, the download was executed before the prompt was shown. Anyway, we got an idea of possible *plugpoints* to plug in our logic.

See diff below. It might not follow conventions, standards and practices and it's not meant to be a complete patch or a commit.
