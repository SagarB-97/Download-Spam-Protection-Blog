excerpt: Decided a basic workflow and plan for the project
---

The workflow for the project will be as follows :

- Block the second download of a browser session
- Block the second download associated with a particular 'origin' of the download
- Differentiate between user and auto initiated downloads
- Block the second user initiated download associated with an origin
- Implement a user prompt that confirms if the user wants to allow multiple downloads
- Implement a permission mechanism
- Telemetry

Bugzilla bugs will be set up for each of these bugs and will be updated shortly.
